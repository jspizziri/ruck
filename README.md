# Ruck App

Ruck is an opinionated Scrum PM tool. It is designed to work entirely and directly off of the API's & functionality provided by GitLab. This keeps the code lightweight, and fully integrated. Ruck provides a management interface on top of the GitLab issue system:

* Organize issues by list
* Prioritize issues in each list
* Track the status of issues in progress
* Classify the type of each issue
* Comment, describe, assign, etc. issues
